Assignment 2 ::

 

Target.com allows our customers to post comment/feedback on specific products in the product details page. These comments are visible to all other customers. 
Develop a REST API to moderate/validate the comment text to prevent customers from posting objectionable content.
The REST API is expected to take a piece of text as an input and respond with feedback regarding objectionable content

 

#Example

·        URL: http://localhost:8080/api/comment/This is the test to check the objectionable content damn

·        Response: {"comment":"This is the test to check for objectionable content damn", "hasObjectionableContent":true,"objectionalWords":["damn"]}
